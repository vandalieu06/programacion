Alchemy Emperor of the Divine Dao

Rain Country, Ling Clan Residence in Gray Cloud Town. The moon has passed the middle of the night sky.
Ling Han spent exactly ten seconds to confirm one fact: he truly had been reincarnated.
Spending ten seconds just to confirm a fact was extremely inconceivable to a strong person from the Heaven Tier, but at the same time, it also proved that what had happened to him was just as inconceivable.
In his previous life, he stood at the summit of martial arts and had completely unprecedented achievements in the art of alchemy. The “Three Fire Guide” that he had invented had even caused a revolution in the field of theory of alchemy, and he was respectfully titled “Alchemy Emperor”.
